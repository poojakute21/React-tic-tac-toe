Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, 
who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, 
vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
Players: 2
Skill(s) required: Strategy, tactics, observation
Genres: Paper-and-pencil game, Board game, Strategy game

Logic developed For Game:
When the user starts the game or the page is loaded, the first player's turn will be the next step up.
Then second player turn. It will show you which players turn now.
You can Go to the steps you want and start the game from that step.
When we get winner we need to start the game again.
